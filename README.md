# Smart Home System

The Smart Home System is a collection of gRPC services designed to manage and control various smart home devices, including doorbells and lighting systems. This project consists of two main components: the doorbell system and the lighting system.

## Doorbell System

The doorbell system provides functionalities related to doorbell operations, such as live video feed streaming, event notifications, and silent mode control. Users can interact with the doorbell system through a client application, allowing them to view live video feeds, check today's events, toggle silent mode, and receive notifications about doorbell events.

## Lighting System

The lighting system allows users to manage and control smart lighting devices within their homes. It offers features such as checking the current status of lights, adjusting brightness levels, changing colors, and turning lights on or off. Users can control their lighting setup through a client application, providing convenience and flexibility in managing their home lighting environment.

## Installation

To install and run the Smart Home System, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies by running `npm install`.
4. Start the server by running `npm start`.
5. Access the client application to interact with the system.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can use the client application to interact with the doorbell and lighting systems. Follow the prompts in the client application to perform various actions, such as viewing live video feeds, adjusting lighting settings, and managing doorbell operations.
